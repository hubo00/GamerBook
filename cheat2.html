        <h2>Red Dead Redemption cheats:</h2>
        <p>This page contains the list of cheat codes that can be used in Red Dead Redemption. There are several types of cheats available in RDR - some can be entered in the Cheat Menu, while some are automatially unlocked from the beginning of the game.<br><br>
            Cheats are entered and activated by navigating to the Cheats tab of the Options menu in the pause screen. To activate a cheat, toggle it to "On" in the Cheats menu - be aware you'll no longer be able to save or unlock trophies until you restart a cheat-free play session from the main menu.</p>
