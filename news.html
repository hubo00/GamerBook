            <h6>The Outlast Trials is a 4-player survival horror set during the Cold War</h6>
            <p>Red Barrels' next Outlast game is a co-op horror romp, as Chris predicted when the studio teased it in October. The Outlast Trials isn't a direct follow-up of the earlier strictly singleplayer games, though it is set in the same spooky universe. As test subjects in a mystery Cold War experiment, players will be able to scare themselves stupid on their lonesome or work together with up to three unfortunate pals. It isn't clear what trials the experiment's victims will have to endure, but there is some art you can stare at below.</p>
            <p><img id="outlast" src="images/outlast.jpg" alt="outlast">It looks like night vision goggles will be replacing the earlier games' camera, but for a moment I thought they might be VR headsets. They're obviously not, but Red Barrels hasn't announced platforms, or anything, really, so it could still have VR support. According to Red Barrels co-founder David Chateauneuf, the proof of concept is complete and the team is now in development mode. It's still very early days, then, and there's no release date. In the meantime, here's what we thought of the previous game, Outlast 2.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <h6>Where will Griffin’s 2019 League roster be playing in the upcoming season?</h6>
            <p>Griffin’s legendary roster split up for the LCK 2020 season, but the players aren’t done fighting.

                Griffin is one of the most popular teams in the League of Legends Champions Korea league (LCK). And this isn’t because there’s a historical legacy behind it, but rather, because of how far the team climbed over the course of only two seasons.<br><br>
                The team only qualified for the LCK in 2018. But in the LCK, Griffin were a force to be reckoned with from the beginning. The team finished its first regular season in second place. With no roster changes, Griffin just kept improving. And this year, it resulted in winning the organization’s first presence at Worlds.<br><br>
                But the roster hasn’t had it easy. A number of issues regarding the players’ contracts and management surfaced to the public, so the players announced free agency as soon as they could. Being as skilled as they are, it was expected that they’d quickly get picked up by other LCK teams in case they decided not to stay with Griffin.
