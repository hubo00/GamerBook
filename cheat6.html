        <p>If you're growing accustomed to the usual surroundings in Tamriel after so many years of adventuring, then trying out some Skyrim cheats may be just what you need to freshen things up again. Fancy learning every spell, perk, and skill with a couple of easy commands? Or exploring an area of Skyrim that you could never get to through legitimate means? If you're a PC player then those options and many more are at your fingertips, as we've got all the Skyrim console commands you could need to become the ultimate Dragonborn, and these should help keep you occupied until the eventual arrival of Elder Scrolls 6. Unfortunately for those playing on console, there aren't any Skyrim cheats available for you, but at least if you visit these Skyrim hidden chest locations you can grab some decent loot.</p>

        <h3>How to use Skyrim console commands</h3>
        <p>As with many other PC games, entering Skyrim console commands is simply a case of pressing the tilde (~) key to open up the developer console, then typing in the command code in the correct format. You can enter multiple codes to stack up various different effects, then hit tilde once again to return to the game and reap the ill-gotten rewards you've given yourself. Unless otherwise stated, entering the same code a second time should turn it off again.<br><br>
            This may sound obvious, but it's worth reinforcing that using some of these codes (especially in combination with others) can cause glitches, mess up ongoing storylines, or crash your game entirely, so make sure you create a back up save and keep it separate before you start playing around - otherwise you may find you've permanently broken your progress, and nobody wants to deal with that in a game the size of Skyrim. Also, achievements will be disabled as soon as you start entering these codes, so unfortunately you won't be able to cheat your way to completing any challenges.
