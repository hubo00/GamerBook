        <h3>Is there a GTA 5 money cheat?</h3>
        <p>It's a shame, but GTA 5 sadly has no money cheat for instant cash, and never has. You'll have to earn cash from doing in-game activities instead, like playing the stock market, or from businesses or side missions on the map. You can't glitch the game to receive extra money, either. <br><br>
            If you're wondering about GTA Online money cheats or hacks, Rockstar firmly doesn't allow them. "Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways."</p>
